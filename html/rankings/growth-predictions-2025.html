  <p class="news__p"><span class="news__dateline">Cambridge, Massachusetts</span> – The economic pole of global growth has taken a marked shift over the past few years from China to neighboring India, where it is likely to stay over the coming decade, according to new growth projections presented by researchers at the <u><a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid">Center for International Development at Harvard University</a></u> (CID). Growth in emerging markets is predicted to continue to outpace that of advanced economies, though not uniformly. The projections are optimistic about new growth hubs in East Africa and new segments of Southeast Asia, led by Indonesia and Vietnam. The growth projections are based on a single measure of each country’s economy, what the researchers term economic complexity, which captures the diversity and sophistication of the productive capabilities embedded in a country’s exports.</p>

  <p class="news__p">In examining the latest 2015 global trade data, CID researchers find a marked turn in trade winds, as 2015 marks the first year for which global trade volumes have fallen since the 2009 global financial crisis. This time around, the fall in trade was driven largely by the fall in oil prices. High oil prices had driven a decade of rapid growth in oil economies, outpacing expectations. Since the decline in oil prices in 2015, growth in oil economies ground to a halt, where it is likely to stay, according to the projections, given little progress on diversification and complexity. </p>

  <p class="news__p">“The major oil economies are experiencing the pitfalls of economic models dependent on one resource, meanwhile India, Indonesia, and Vietnam have accumulated new capabilities that allow for more diverse and more complex production that predicts faster growth in the coming years,” said Ricardo Hausmann, director of CID, professor at the Harvard Kennedy School (HKS), and the leading researcher of <a href="http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/"><u><b>The Atlas of Economic Complexity</b></u> (<u>www.atlas.cid.harvard.edu</u>).</p>

  <p class="news__p">The projections warn of a continued slowdown in global growth over the coming decade. India and Uganda top the list of the fastest growing economies to 2025, at 7.7 percent annually, but for different reasons. Uganda joins three other East African countries in the top 10 fastest growing countries, though the region’s growth prospects are largely driven by rapid population growth. On a per capita basis, Uganda is the only East African country that remains in the top 10 in the growth projections, though at 4.5 percent annually its prospects are more modest. On the other hand, the researchers attribute India’s rapid growth prospects as reflecting the slow, arduous process of adding new productive capabilities to make a more diverse set of products of gradually greater complexity. India has made inroads in diversifying its export base to include more complex sectors, such as chemicals, vehicles, and certain electronics. </p>

  <p class="news__p">The new 2015 data reveal a decline in China’s export volume. China’s economic complexity ranking also falls four spots for the first time since the global financial crisis. Nevertheless, China has made rapid gains in its economic complexity by adding productive capabilities and diversifying its exports that have doubled per capita income in less than a decade. The growth projections therefore have China growing above the world average, though at 4.4 percent annually for the coming decade, the slowdown in growth is expected to continue as China has already realized many of the income gains from its rising complexity.</p>

  <p class="news__p">The researchers place the diversity of tacit productive knowledge—or knowhow—that a society has at the heart of the economic growth story. Over a decade of research at CID has revealed a central stylized fact of global economies: poor countries produce few goods that nearly every country can produce, while rich countries produce a great diversity of goods, including products that few countries know how to produce. Thus, complex export products require greater diversity of knowhow that is only available in a few countries that allow them to grow faster than those countries that export a few, simple products. This measure of economic complexity is able to closely explain differences in country incomes. Yet the true value of the measure is its accuracy in predicting future growth. “Economic complexity not only describes why countries are rich or poor today, but holds greater accuracy than other single measure in predicting future growth, including five times greater accuracy than the Global Competitiveness Index,” said Sebastian Bustos, a lead CID researcher in trade research and the economic complexity measurement.</p>

  <h4 class="news__subhead">New Economic Complexity Index Rankings</h4>
  <p class="news__p">CID also released new country rankings of the 2015 Economic Complexity Index (ECI), the measure that forms the basis for much of the growth projections. The ECI finds the most complex countries in the world, as measured by the average complexity of their export basket, remain Japan, Switzerland, Germany, South Korea, and Austria. Of the 40 most complex countries, the biggest risers in the rankings for the decade ending in 2015 have been the Philippines (ECI rank: up 28 positions to rank 32nd globally), Thailand (+11 to 25th), China (+10 to 23rd), Lithuania (+9 to 30th), and South Korea (+8 to 4th). Conversely, the biggest losers have been Canada (-9 to 33rd), Serbia, Belarus, Spain (-6 to 29th), and France (-6 to 16th). </p>

  <p class="news__p">Those countries that show the fastest declines globally in the complexity rankings in the decade ending in 2015 are grappling with significant political interference in the elimination of productive knowhow, with the largest declines in Cuba (-50), Venezuela (-44), Zimbabwe (-23), Tajikistan (-22), Libya (-22), and Argentina (-18). Overall, the researchers emphasize that these economic growth developments are too often prescribed to individual politicians, rather than the long-run developments in acquiring new knowhow and effectively putting it to use in the labor market. Globally, the fastest risers in complexity in 2015 have been the Philippines, Malawi (+26 to 94th), Uganda (+24 to 77th), Vietnam (+24 to 64th), and Cambodia (+16 to 88th).</p>

  <p class="news__p">The growth projections highlight that economic growth fails to follow one easy pattern or rule system, whether democratic governance, university enrollment, or country size in describing what unites the projected fastest growing countries that include India, Turkey, Indonesia, Uganda, and Bulgaria. “What best unites this growth landscape is the focus on the accumulation of new productive knowhow to build the capacity to make more products, and products of incrementally greater complexity,” said Timothy Cheston, a CID researcher on the project.</p>

  <p class="news__p">The research further dispels conventional policy approaches, such as those that emphasize innovation as driving growth, when the fastest growing countries are those that are engaging a process of adaptation of existing products to new locations. The fastest growing countries are those who are able to more readily add new capabilities to produce those products that already exist in the world, but are of greater complexity and higher productivity than the average for that location. The projections divide global countries into three basic categories: those countries with too few productive capabilities to be able to easily diversify into related products, including Bangladesh, Ecuador, and Guinea; those countries which have added new capabilities that make diversification and growth readily feasible, which include India, Indonesia, and Turkey; and those advanced countries that already produce nearly all existing products who must innovate by developing wholly new products, a risk-laden process that predicts slow growth, which include Japan, Germany, and the United States.</p>

  <p class="news__p">The economic complexity growth projections also offer new information when compared to more comprehensive estimates done by the IMF and the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Namely, growth projections isolate those countries whose growth is being driven by real progress in productive diversification. Relative to EIU predictions, CID researchers are less optimistic about a set of countries that include Bangladesh, Cambodia, Iran, Sri Lanka, and Cuba. Conversely, CID researchers have greater optimism for the growth prospects of Uganda, Guatemala, Mexico, Tanzania, and Brazil.</p>
